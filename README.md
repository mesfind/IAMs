# Integrated Assessment  Modeling and Analysis With Python


Carbon dioxide $$CO_2$$ – the most dominant greenhouse gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial production, and land use change. We cover $$CO_2$$ – global emissions, annual, cumulative, per capita, and consumption-based emissions


But $$CO_2$$ is not the only greenhouse gas that is driving global climate change. There are a number of others – methane, nitrous oxide, and trace gases such as the group of __F-gases__ – which have contributed a significant amount of warming to date.

Here we look at total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the world, plus breakdowns of other major gases including methane and nitrous oxide.



This Lesson main focus is modeling and Analysis   on Manufacturing industry  to reduce climate change based on IPCC  protocols that includes:

* Introduction to Python Programming
* Mathematical Modeling and Optimization
* Integrated Assessment Modeling
  * Simple Integrated Assessment
  * Complex Integrated Assssment
* Senarios Analysis and Visualizaton for IAMs


Objectives:

* The Learner will be able to Anlayze Intergrated Assessment Modeling(IAM) based on IPCC SR1.5

Prerequisites:

Learners need to understand what files and directories are and what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the [Unix Shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
Learners need to have some prior knowledge of Python. For instance, what is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) is sufficient.
Learners must install Python. See the [setup instructions](https://mesfind.github.io/climate/setup/).
A few additional python libraries need to be installed before the class starts. See [here](https://mesfind.github.io/climate/setup/) which packages and how to install them.
